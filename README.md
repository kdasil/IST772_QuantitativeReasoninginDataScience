# IST772 Quantitative Reasoning in Data Science

## Course Description
Classical statistical procedures used in information transfer research. Emphasis on underlying rationale for each procedure and on criteria for selecting procedures in a given research situation.

Quantitative data analytics stands in the center of the field of data science. Yet most people who make use of analytical results – and a surprising number who produce those results – have little idea of how the nature of the data and the analysis impacts their interpretation. Uncertainty is an intrinsic and inescapable characteristic of data. If we fail to understand uncertainty when working with our data, at best we will make poorer decisions than necessary and at worst we will make catastrophic errors based on mistaken assumptions. Statistical inference is the process by which we make sense of uncertainty in data, and this course focuses on establishing a thoughtful and thorough understanding of statistical inference.
This course will help you understand contemporary methods of statistical inference regardless of the specific type of analysis you are undertaking. The primary goal of this course is for you to learn the techniques and concepts that facilitate drawing sensible conclusions from samples of quantitative data. 

## Learning Objectives

The course has three major goals focusing on knowledge, skills, and practice. By the end of this course you will be able to:

- Demonstrate knowledge of contemporary inferential statistical concepts (from the perspective of two contemporary philosophies) and data analysis strategies by making sensible choices about:
  - How data collection, the data themselves, and the analysis processes relate to the kinds of inferences that can be drawn
  - What kinds of analysis will be feasible and developing the skill of planning data collection and measurement to facilitate appropriate analysis
- Practice effective data science analytics:
  - Preparing data for analysis, including screening data, dealing with missing data, doing data transformations
  - Testing assumptions that data must meet for analyses and inferences to be reasonable
  - Interpreting data analysis results and outputs and communicating them to others using language that accurately describes uncertainty
  - Leaving a documentation/provenance trail for other analysts to follow and reproduce your work
- Demonstrate competence and/or mastery of the skills needed for use of a popular statistics and data management platform to conduct sound and reproducible analyses including:
  - Installing R and R-studio, and creating readable code to conduct analyses
  - Exploring the limitations of existing data sets and how their provenance influences what analyses to perform and what inferences to draw
  - Choosing appropriate R procedures and configuring the relevant operational parameters
